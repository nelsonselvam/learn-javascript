/* ASYNCHRONOUS CODE

    synchronous code - code that runs line by line sequentially. it waits on previous operation to complete if any.

    asynchronous code - allows multiple operations to be performed concurrently without waiting
                        doesn't block the execution flow & allows programs to continue
                        (I/O operations, network requests, timers, etc.)
                        handled with: callbacks, promises, async/await
