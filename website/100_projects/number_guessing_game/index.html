    <h2> Thanks for playing!!!   </h2>
    <h4>   From now on, then, resolve to live as a grown-up who is making progress, and make whatever you think best a law that you never set aside. 
        And whenever you encounter anything that is difficult or pleasurable or highly or lowly regarded, remember that the contest is now, you are at the Olympic games, you cannot wait any longer, 
        and that your progress is wrecked or preserved by a single day and a single event. This is how Socrates fulfilled himself by attending to nothing except reason in everything he encountered. 
        And you, although you are not yet Socrates, should live as someone who at least wants to be Socrates.”
